            <h1>Inspiration</h1>
            <p>Art, to me, is a form of expression, a window into the depths of the human soul. It offers a unique perspective on the world, and each piece is a personal interpretation, a visual exploration of my surroundings. 
                I am particularly drawn to the challenge of capturing fleeting moments in time, striving to convey the emotions felt within those very instances.
                My artistic journey was ignited by Michael Mahoney. 
                His artistic abilities, coupled with his patience in occasionally guiding me, fostered a deep love and fascination for the artistic world. I am profoundly grateful for his influence, as well as the support of every family member who has contributed to my growth. 
                Ultimately, my goal extends beyond simply developing and refining my skills. I aim to inspire viewers to experience the world with a renewed sense of wonder, as if seeing it's beauty for the first time.
