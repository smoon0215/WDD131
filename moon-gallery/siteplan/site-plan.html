			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>Hello! I’m Samantha Moon, an artist based in Idaho and a student of Computer Science at Brigham Young University – Idaho. My artwork is an ongoing journey of exploration, where I experiment with various techniques and styles, drawing inspiration from both intuition and traditional artistic methods. While I typically work with acrylic on canvas and occasionally oils, I find myself captivated by the beauty of both nature and man-made structures. Each piece in this portfolio reflects my desire to express complex emotions and stories beyond words, capturing moments of connection and insight through visual art.</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
